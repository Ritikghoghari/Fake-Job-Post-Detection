# Fake Job Post Detection

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect fake job postings.  
It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and a Streamlit web app for interactive predictions.

## Project Overview

Fake job postings are a serious problem on job portals and can mislead job seekers.  
This project aims to build a classifier that automatically detects whether a job post is genuine or fake using machine learning and text analysis.
